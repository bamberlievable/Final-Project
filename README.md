# Final-Project
AGTech Website Design Final Project
The Urban Wild (https://www.theurbanwild.us/) provides 10 weeks of agriculture, technology and construction training to New Yorkers between 18-30, 
to help students start their journeys in Agtech. Over the course of the program, we partnered with a community garden to build a hydroponic structure,
took classes in coding and agrciulture to understand farming and plant care, and finished the program by coming up with an idea for a hydroponic system
we could implement in our communities.
For my final project, I tried to create a website that sold kraky kits to support community memebers interested in growing their own food, in their homes.
